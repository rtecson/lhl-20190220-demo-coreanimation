## Core Animation

Today we talked about Core Animation and `CALayer`s. Core Animation is the underlying framework for animation in iOS and macOS. In most cases you should use `UIView` animations, but it is important to know what the underlying technology is. `CALayer`s back `UIView`s in iOS.

The two main types of animations we looked at are `CABasicAnimation`s and `CAKeyframeAnimation`s. `CABasicAnimation`s have a `fromValue` and `toValue` that the layer interpolates between. `CAKeyframeAnimation`s can have an array of values or a path that are interpolated along. We can control how the points/values are interpolated along by providing a timing function or an array of `keyTimes`.

There's an informal delegate we can use on animation to receive callbacks when animations start or stop. There's also a block-based approach with `CATransaction`, where we can set a block that will run when the animations in the transaction are completed.
